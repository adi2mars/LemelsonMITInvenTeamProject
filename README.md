# LemelsonMITInvenTeamProject-
Created a wearable device with a companion Android app to monitor physiological symptoms of sepsis and generate a sepsis risk assessment.

Used Arduino and conductive thread to create the prototype device. Programmed with C++ on Arduino with external libraries to implement sensors and created a algorithm that would cycle through the sensors to ensure that accurate readings

Developed a user-friendly companion app with Android Studio which allowed the user to input data and receive the sensor data through Bluetooth. Developed an algorithm to use this data to generate a risk assessment

Android Studio, Java, C++, Arduino
